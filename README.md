# social.vtr.pt

This website serves as a public hub for all the social links both for my works under Grandmen123, and just for myself.

This website was initially made up of a single HTML & CSS page using bootstrap, and it was developed as a part of an 100 day coding challenge for web development. Since then I have migrated it to be a React.JS App, using Firebase as the source for the Social Links Data.

### Running & Bug Finding
If you want to run the website to test for bugs or just mess around, start by cloning the repo locally, then run:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

You're free to access data from Firebase, yet you won't be able to write to it for safety reasons.

Feel free to report bugs at the bug page here on GitHub and I'll address them!
